# Saumil-s-py-lab
My journey from python beginner to advanced 

Hello guys I am saumil and I am beginner to coding and I am sharing my python journey with everyone in this repo..
ðŸ‘‰ Once I thought critically that what to name my repo??? and suddenly i remembered that nowadays many tech companies are building "superintelligence labs" , so from that I got idea to name this repo "Saumil's py lab" but due to GitHub's rules i was not able to use inverted comma . So this is my basic introduction and we will continue our journey...
